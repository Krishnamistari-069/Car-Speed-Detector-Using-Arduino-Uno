**🚗 Car Speed Detector using Arduino Uno**
📌 **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates a Car Speed Detection System built using Arduino Uno.
The system measures the speed of a moving car (or any object) using IR sensors / ultrasonic sensors placed at a fixed distance. When the object passes through both sensors, the Arduino calculates the time taken and determines the speed using the formula:
**Speed = Distance / time**
This project can be applied in traffic monitoring, speed control systems, and smart road safety applications.

**⚙️ Components Used**
-Arduino Uno
-IR Sensors / Ultrasonic Sensors (2 units)
-LCD Display (16x2) / Serial Monitor
-Buzzer (for overspeed alert)
-Breadboard and Jumper Wires
-Power Supply

**🔧 Working Principle**
1.Two sensors are placed a known distance apart (e.g., 10 cm or 1 m).
2.When a car/object passes the first sensor, Arduino starts a timer.
3.When it crosses the second sensor, Arduino stops the timer.
4.Speed is calculated = Distance ÷ Time.
5.The speed is displayed on the LCD/Serial Monitor.
6.If the speed exceeds a threshold (e.g., 40 km/h), the buzzer is triggered.

**🚀 Applications**
-Vehicle speed monitoring on highways
-Smart traffic management
-School/college projects in Embedded Systems / IoT

**📊 Future Enhancements**
-Store speed data in SD card or cloud for analysis
-Wireless transmission using ESP8266 / Bluetooth
-Integration with Camera for number plate recognition
